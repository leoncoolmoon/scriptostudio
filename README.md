ScriptO Studio is a next-generation Integrated Development and Execution Environment (IDEE) for embedded devices running MicroPython.

Describe in natural language what you want your device to do — and watch it happen instantly. Add a temperature sensor, configure CAN bus logging, or build a custom vehicle monitoring system, all without compiling code or flashing firmware. Your changes take effect immediately, and when you disconnect, your device keeps running autonomously.

Delivered as a PWA that runs in any modern browser, ScriptO Studio communicates over a secure link to the device, providing a rich extensible UI that takes no processing power or resources on the device.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🛡️ Fast, Secure Development

All device access is through hw accelerated TLS and WebRTC, so it's fast and secure. See [Connection](/docs/getting-started/connection/) for details.

### ✏️ Smart Python Editor

Agentic code editor for MicroPython with syntax highlighting, file management, and seamless deployment. You get real-time code execution and debugging with no firmware updates required. Just describe what you want, and the AI agent does the rest. See [Editor Features](/docs/user-guide/editor-features/) and [Using the Agent](/docs/agent/usage/).

## 🚀 Quick Start

ScriptO Studio runs on any device that runs MicroPython with **[pyDirect](https://github.com/jetpax/pyDirect)** extensions installed. Currently ESP32-S3 and ESP32-P4 are supported, but MicroPython on ZephyrOS is in the pipeline, opening up a world of new devices, such as Raspberry Pi RP2350.

> 📖 **New to ScriptO Studio?** Check out the **[Getting Started Guide](/docs/getting-started/)** for step-by-step instructions.

### 1. Flash pyDirect Firmware

  </a>
</p>

Works directly in your browser. No software to install. See the [Flashing Firmware](/docs/device-setup/flashing-firmware/) page for details.

### 2. Open ScriptO Studio

Visit **[scriptostudio.com/app/](https://scriptostudio.com/app/)** — works on desktop, tablet, or phone.

### 3. Install an Extension

Click **Extensions** → Browse → **Install**. Extensions are hosted on **[ScriptoHub](https://scriptohub.ai)**. Your device starts running the extension immediately. See [Extensions Overview](/docs/user-guide/extensions/).

### 4. Disconnect and Go

Your device keeps running the Extension autonomously. Access its web UI directly, or remotely via VPN.
